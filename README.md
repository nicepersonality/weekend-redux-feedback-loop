### Completed Features
​​
- [ ] A multi-part form allows users to leave feedback for today.
- **There are 4 views for the form parts:**
- [ ] How are you feeling today?
- [ ] How well are you understanding the content?
- [ ] How well are you being supported?
- [ ] Any comments you want to leave?

- [ ] Redux stores feedback data across views.
- [ ] Each part of the form is in its own route.
- [ ] Clicking next moves the user to the appropriate step​.
- [ ] A *Review* component displays the results of each step clearly at all times.
- [ ] When the form is completely filled out, a submit button sends the completed feedback to the database.
- [ ] A success page confirms the data has been added.

### Next Steps
​
- [ ] Display all of the existing feedback at the route `/admin`. The most recently added feedback should appear at the top of the list. Allow the user to delete existing feedback. Prompt the user to confirm prior to deleting the feedback from the database.
- [ ] Update this README.md to describe the project.
- [ ] Improve the styling of the app using Material-UI.
- [ ] Add the ability to flag an existing feedback entry for further review on the `/admin` view.
- [ ] Deploy the project to Heroku.
